    "## Recapping prior thoughts\n",
    "The BFS algorithm I implemented in my most recent experiement was interesting for a few reasons. For one, it was able of exploring nodes in an order of lowest cost first. The algorithm was also interesting in that it allowed for costs to be associated with each action in the action space. However, there was an important limitation. Basically, the algorithm has no guidance mechanism to make educated guesses as in which general direction to expand. What this means is that the algorithm will be spending time expanding nodes that, although low in cost, are may not be nodes that will lead the drone efficiently to its destination."

    "## The motivation for A Star\n",
    "Enter A Star Search. As I understand it, it's an alogrithm that basically allows the drone to make that educated guess using what's called a heuristic function. Like a cost value, a heuristic value is assigned to each node in the search space. When considering which node to expand to next, the algorithm will select the node with the lowest F score. In other words, the node whose sum of heuristic and cumulative cost score are lowest. Like with Uniform Cost, A Star can be implemented using a Priority Queue data structure in Python, and that's what I'll be doing in this notebook. "
